  // Because we are implementing multiplayer, our pushes will tend to have
  // *lots* of very fine-grained events. Think, for example, of mouse moves.
  //
  // I hear you saying, dear reader: "It's silly to send and process all these
  // little teeny movemove events. Why not collapse consecutive runs of the
  // same mutation type either on client before sending, or server before
  // processing.
  //
  // We could do that, but there are cases that are more complicated. Consider
  // drags for example: when a user drags an object, the mutations we get are
  // like: moveCursor,moveShape,moveCursor,moveShape,etc.
  //
  // It's less clear how to collapse sequences like this. In the specific case
  // of moveCursor/moveShape, you could come up with something that make sense,
  // but generally Replicache mutations are arbitrary functions of the data
  // at a moment in time. We can't re-order or collapse them and get a correct
  // result without re-running them.
  //
  // Instead, we take a different tack:
  // * We send all the mutations, faithfully, from the client (and rely on gzip
  //   to compress it).
  // * We open a single, exclusive transaction against MySQL to process all
  //   mutations in a push.
  // * We heavily cache (in memory) within that transaction so that we don't
  //   have to go all the way back to MySQL for each tiny mutation.
  // * We flush all the mutations to MySQL in parallel at the end.
  //
  // As a nice bonus this means that (a) we don't have to have any special-case
  // collapse logic anywhere, and (b) we get a nice perf boost by parallelizing
  // the flush at the end.
